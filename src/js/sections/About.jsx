        <b>History:</b><br />
        I consider that I started my carreer when I was a
        teenager. When I was 13 years old I started studying HTML all by myself on the
        internet. Then a year later I was already writing my own algorithms to develop
        macros to online games, some of these macros reached 300 lines.
      </p>
      <p className="flow-text">
        When I reached 18 years old I started my B.Sc. in Computer Science and found
        my passion. At the second quarter of the first year I was already practicing
        Java and Object Oriented Programming on my own. At the beginning of my second
        year I started my first web application project using PHP and MySQL.
      </p>
      <p className="flow-text">
        Since then I never stopped developing web and mobile applications. I got my
        Masters degree in 2014 and co-founded an IT startup last quarter in 2013.
        Last year I started to work as a Professor at a federal institute of science,
        technology and innovation.
